Everyone knows (or should know) that no REAL program has no bugs. As we
always try to make a program technically perfect, usually it just doesn't
happen, therefore..

 Known bugs in this code
 -----------------------

1. When a remote who is done .w @<talker>, If a user tries to .quit while
   they're in the middle of their remote .who, their connection wont
   disconnect until the remote who finishes (I'm not great with child
   processes so if anymore can tell or show me how to fix it or write the code
   that fixes it, let me know)

   Solution if problem occurs: Disable remote whos
