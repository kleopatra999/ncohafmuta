Credits for this code distribution go to..
------------------------------------------

Deep, for writing the original Iforms code.

Neil Robertson, for writing NUTS, which Iforms was originally based on.

Arctic, for writing the auth_user code which is public domain.

Jazzin, for tons of input, code ideas, finding bugs, adding socials,
adding code, bullshit work, and being a pain in the ass. ;-) but NOT for
filling up the server disk with a dumb-ass CGI script!

Joelie, for being the BIGGEST pain in the ass about bugs, glitches, adding
new features, not releasing tons of patch levels, and for blaming me for
everything that's not my fault.

Calysto for doing bullshit (i.e. tedious) work regarding ANSI compliance
and being a dork. ;-) He's the "Here's 1000 warnings, here's how to fix
them..do it!" man.

Rager, for joining me in the ritual sacrifice of sleep to help me test
multi-commands and other things, for going through an endless number of
reboots, for the races to log back into the talker after a reboot, and for
being her natural wonderful freaky self.

OliverJones (author of the TinyMUCK code) and Cynbe ru Taren (Chee Lan
- muq author) for their help on an accept()/fork() problem.

Nate for compiling on OS/2 with EMX

Fellow coders, admins, and talker users for their input/ideas.
