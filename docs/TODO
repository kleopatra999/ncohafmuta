Things to do..in this particular order!
---------------------------------------
(if you would like to assist on any of these and are good in C,
 let me know..code@ncohafmuta.com)

Add level-based mail and massmail to .smail command with options, add #define MAIL_LEVEL for
the level allowed to do mass mails to other levels

Fix/enhance write out code in write_str() write_str_nr() because it 
doesn't take in account color codes when writing out column-specific text 
blocks to user

Finish ".set who" for different format .who lists

Change options for:
 Deleting/reading mail   and   Wiping/reading message boards
 New options:
  <number>-             <number> to end
  -<number>             beginning to <number>
  <number>-<number>     <number> to <number>
  <number>              just message number <number>
  l<number>             the last <number> messages

.admin command to administrate almost all aspects and settings of the
talker. The command will be command line based with descendingly specific
levels. Sort of like the interface for Cisco IOS with their routers. All
changes made using the command will be memory-effective ONLY unless saved
to the config. A huge feature of this will be allowing administrator to
edit,load, and save multiple configs on the fly. With one command you can
change your talker to a whole other theme with new rooms,
strings, and command names.
 Tentative commands:
   MAIN
	commit	              - Save current settings to memory and
				current boot
	commit startup-config - Save current settings to the default
				boot config
	commit <config name>  - Save config settings to a new or
				existing alternate config
	copy <config> <config> - Copy a whole existing config to a new or
				existing config name
	config <type>	      - Enter configuration commannd line for
				<type> which can be rooms,strings,globals,
				or commands
	load		      - Reload the current SAVED disk config
	load <config name>    -	Load specific config into talker.
	show configs	      - List all configurations
	show <type>	      - Show settings for <type> under current
				config
	delete <config name>  - Deletes a specific configuration
   GENERAL LINE COMMANDS
	?		      - List commands for this line menu
	exit		      - Exit up from this line menu
   ROOM CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS
	show		      - Show all settings for this config
	add <room name>
		exit <room name>
		hide
		atmos
		publock
		privlock
	delete <room name>
	modify <room name>
   STRING CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS
   GLOBAL CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS
   COMMAND CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS

Still, multi-user recepients for .tell (and other private commands), .move, 
and .smail.

Allocate memory for structures dynamically. Right now user structures are 
allocated on bootup for MAX_USERS. Should allocate as needed (login/logout)
Same for rooms. All rooms are allocated on bootup. Should be as
needed..i.e. create and destroy rooms based on if users are in them, or
are immediately ready to enter them.

Split code into multiple C files (in progress!)

Enhance color codes so users can STACK codes. like:
^HR^BLthis is bold red and blinking^

Create standards for different terminal types

Implement and create load-in module support. Maybe have a directory with 
a .c file for every user .<command>
This also includes re-loading of commands and other data from 
inside the talker.

Port code to Win95/98/NT

Greatly enhance web port so that it can truely send and receive HTTP
requests. (75% functional) Need to fix POST support so to can do logins
from web ports for users to use advanced functions in webpage (send mail,
read mail, read help, read message boards)

Start inter-talker connectivity

Maybe create and implement an email gateway to external email. Maybe have
a talker email account and to send email to a person you put their name
in the Subject: field. Or maybe just <name>.<talker_name>@<talker's host>

**Things being considered still**

Using a database
Using Async I/O threads
Encrypting all user files
Mail folders w/folder management
.set icq, .set age (maybe? possibly too customized for the distribution
code)
Add route command to display a route between two rooms.  Maybe 
make it an option of another command instead of making a new command? Or maybe
the user should not be lazy and use .map? :)
