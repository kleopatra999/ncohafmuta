Yes folks, it's finally here!

All inhabitants of PinWHeeLs are invited to Pymatuning State Forest in Ohio 
to meet your long lost Internet buddies.

*** ^HRGeneral Information^ ***

The get-together will begin on Friday, May 15, and continue through Sunday,
May 17. We're staying at the Pymatuning State Forest, which is on the 
northeast side of Ohio, on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. You're welcome to
stay all weekend or stay a few hours, it's up to you. You can stay overnight
at the forest either via camping or renting a cabin. Costs to you will be
transportation, the cost of either a campsite or cabin, and any food & drink 
you want to bring. These costs can be split with friends to make things easier.

Booze are allowed at the get-together, but only indoors (this I got from the 
main office at Pymatuning). Which means, hide your beer when you walk from 
place to place ;) You must be over 21 to consume alcoholic beverages. If you're 
caught drinking and you're underage, we don't know you ;)

*** ^HRRenting a Cabin^ ***

According to Ohio State Forest Cabin Reservation, as of March 20, Pymatuning 
has 26 available cabins for the weekend of our get-together. These cabins cost 
$54.50 per night and sleep up to 4 people each, with a double bed and hide-a-bed.
The cabins include heat, 1 bedroom with bath and shower, living area, TV, kitchen
with cooking utensils, stove (but no oven), small refrigerator with freezer, couch
with hide-a-bed, charcoal grill and picnic tables.

If you choose to rent a cabin for the weekend, you will have to call and reserve
one. Call ASAP, because cabins go fast. You snooze, you lose! Here's the 
instructions to reserve a cabin...

Reservation Instructions

   1.Call Ohio State Park Reservation number: 1-800-282-7275 
   2.Tell the Reservationist you're like to rent a standard cabin at Pymatuning 
     Park for May 15th, 16th or both, depending on if you're staying the whole 
	 weekend or just one of the two days. 
   3.Tell the Reservationist that you're part of the PinWHeeLs group, so they can
     arrange for a cabin near the group. 
   4.Upon arrival at Pymatuning, report to the Pymatuning State Forest Office to
     claim your cabin. 

That's it =) You will have to pay for a least one night stay in advance to reserve
your cabin. You can pay the deposit by check, money order or credit card within 
14 days of your reservation.

*** ^HRCampsite Info^ ***

Campsites are on a first come, first serve basis. There are NO reservations for 
campsites. Prices are $14 per campsite, $16 per lakefront campsite. Up to 6 people
are allowed per campsite. You will need to bring your own equipment, food, camping
gear, etc.  Pymatuning does have a bear and wolf population, so you will need to 
be careful about leaving out food or wearing perfumes.
