IF YOUR SCREEN IS MESSED UP, TYPE -->  .set car 1
 If you're new here, here is a quick run-down of what you should
know how to do.  It is suggested that you read the .help files and look 
at all the information regarding the commands available to you.  However 
many people are impatient and ignore them.  That's your choice however it 
usually ends up where some start asking others what this or that command 
does.  In some cases that is the quickest way to get flamed.  The people 
and members here should be above such immaturity, however it would be 
greatly encouraged and appreciated if you learn how use this talker and 
it's functions on your own. All commands begin with a period (.) and the
most common ones are listed below. All commands you can use are listed 
under ".h" If you need any help that you CAN'T find in help files, 
type --> .sos HELP ME!   and if a higher level user is on, they will help
Other help can be found in .faq, .news, .h disclaimer, and .h etiquette
    Please type ".help <command>" for the following universal commands 
found on just about any talker of this format: i.e. ".help who"
