 Syntax:  .semote <user> [']<action>
          /<user> [']<action>
          .semote <user>

Results:  Allows you to emote one user something without anyone else being
          able to see it.  <user> is the person you want to action to.
          <action> is the action you want to do towards him/her.
          This command also allows you to review your semotes if you do not
          specify anything after the .semote command. If you specify a '
          before the action, it will become posessive.
          If you do NOT specify an action, it will send to the user..
          "You sense that <your name> is looking for you in <your_room>"
          while still applying to vis/invis conditions.
