 Syntax:  .set recap <new_capped_name>

Results:  This command allows you to recapitalize your name the way you
          want it. For example, if you're cygnus, you can change it to
          Cygnus, cYgnUs, CYgnUS, etc..but it must be the same name. If
          you wish to totally change your name, use ".set name"
