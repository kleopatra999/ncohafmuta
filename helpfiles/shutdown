 Syntax:  .shutdown -c
          .shutdown [<num_of_minutes>]
          .shutdown -r [<num_of_minutes>]

Results:  Shuts the talker down or reboots it.  It will ask if you really
          want to do this, just in case you accidentally type .shutdown.
          It will quit all users before going down. The "-c" string after
          the command is used to cancel an auto-shutdown/reboot.
          An auto-shutdown is done by specifying a number from 1-32766
          after the shutdown command.
          An auto-reboot is done by specifying a number from 1-32766 after
          the -r option of the shutdown command. Without a number
          specified, the talk reboots immediately.

Example:  To have the talker shut itself down in 3 hours,
          type --> .shutdown 180

  Notes:  On auto-shutdowns/reboots, broadcasts will be given by the
          talker automatically to let you and the other users know how
          long before it will shutdown/reboot. No users need to be online
          for an auto-shutdown or auto-reboot to take place.
