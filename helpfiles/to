 Syntax:  .to <user> <text>
          $ <user> <text>

Results:  This command is just like normally talking, but the text is 
          directed to <user>. <user> MUST be in the room. It's still
          a public message remember.
          Command can be shortened with '$' or whatever you set with .abbrs
          You cannot .to a user that is AFK or BAFK.

Example:  $cygnus Did you go out for dinner?
        Gives.. <your name> says (to cygnus) "Did you go out for dinner?"
