 Syntax:  .whois <search string>
          .whois -h nic.ddn.nil <search string>

Results:  Use the Unix "whois" command to search the Internet's Domain
          Registration Service for info on domain names, sites, or
          even people. If the first syntax returns no info, try the
          second. At the bottom of the info it'll tell you the opposite 
          of which one you picked.
          If you didn't enter a -h host it searches RS.INTERNIC.NET, and it 
          will tell you to look at nic.ddn.mil for more info..and vice-versa.
        
Example:  .whois misty.com
